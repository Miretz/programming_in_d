My notes from reading the book "Programming in D"

The book is available (for free) [here](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html)

To edit/run I'm using Visual Studio Code with the [Code-D plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.code-d).

Simply open a *.d file and run ```code-d: Run document using rdmd```.
